 An Education Without Boundaries 
 At Marist, students receive an outstanding education without any limitations of location. They can avail themselves of opportunities at our main campus and facilities in New York’s beautiful Hudson River Valley, our proximity to the heart of New York City, our campus in Florence, Italy, and any number of our convenient online courses and programs of study. With so many enriching academic and cultural experiences available to them, Marist students are limited only by their imaginations.
