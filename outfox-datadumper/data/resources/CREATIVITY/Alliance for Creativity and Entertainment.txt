Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE) is a coalition launched on June 13, 2017 of over 30 major global entertainment companies and film studios aimed at protecting profits from copyrighted material. The stated mission of ACE is to protect profits, drawing on the anti-piracy resources of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). The organisation plans to conduct research into online pirating, lobby law enforcement to stop and sue pirate enterprises, file sweeping civil litigations, and to "pursue voluntary agreements with responsible parties across the internet ecosystem" â€” such as search engines and broadband providers.They shut down the streaming providers Openload and Streamango on the 31 October 2019.
The organisation promotes itself as marking a new level of coordination among multiple stakeholders.


== Background ==
According to anti-piracy watchdogs, internet users worldwide saved $107.9 billion by streaming from free content distributors in 2016. The efforts of the industry have proven ineffective at preventing online piracy. According to ACE, there are now as few as 480 online services complying with copyright law in an attempt to stem global demand for copyrighted content.
