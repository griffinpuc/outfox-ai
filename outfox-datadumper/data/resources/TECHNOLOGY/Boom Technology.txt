Boom Technology, Inc. (trade name Boom Supersonic) is an American company designing a Mach 1.7 (1,000 kn; 1,800 km/h), 55-passenger supersonic airliner. Named the Boom Overture, the airliner is planned to have a range of 4,250 nmi (7,870 km) and to be introduced in 2029. 
After being incubated by Y Combinator in 2016, Boom Technology raised $51 million of venture capital in 2017, and $100 million by January 2019. The Boom XB-1 Baby Boom one-third-scale demonstrator is expected to begin flight testing in 2021.


== History ==
The company was founded in Denver in 2014.
It participated in a Y Combinator startup incubation program in early 2016, and has been funded by Y Combinator, Sam Altman, Seraph Group, Eight Partners, and others.In March 2017, $33 million were invested by several venture funds: Continuity Fund, RRE Ventures, Palm Drive Ventures, 8VC and Caffeinated Capital.
Boom secured $41 million of total financing by April 2017.
In December 2017, Japan Airlines invested $10 million, raising the company capital to $51 million: enough to build the XB-1 “Baby Boom” demonstrator and complete its testing, and to start early design work on the 55-seat airliner. In January 2019, Boom raised a further $100 million, bringing the total to $151 million, then planning the demonstrator first flight for later in 2019.


== Projects ==


=== XB-1 Baby Boom ===

The XB-1 Baby Boom is a one-third-scale supersonic demonstrator, designed to maintain Mach 2.2, with over 1,000 nmi (1,900 km) of range, and powered by three 4,300 lbf (19 kN) dry General Electric J85-15s.
It is expected to be flight tested in 2021. A simulator for the XB-1 has been constructed using X-Plane 11 to test the flight model.


=== Overture airliner ===

The Overture is a proposed Mach 1.7 (1,000 kn; 1,800 km/h), 65- to 88-passenger supersonic transport with envisaged 4,250 nmi (7,870 km) of range.
With 500 viable routes, Boom suggests there could be a market for 1,000 supersonic airliners with business class fares. It had gathered 76 commitments by December 2017. It would keep the delta wing configuration of Concorde but would be built with composite materials. It would be powered by three dry 15,000–20,000 lbf (67–89 kN) turbofans; a derivative or a clean-sheet design will be selected in 2019.In September 2020, the company announced that it had been contracted to develop the Overture for possible use as Air Force One.
Boom CEO Blake Scholl "estimates that flights on Overture will be available in 2030."In January 2021, Boom announced plans to begin Overture test flights in 2026.
In June, United Airlines announced that it had signed a deal to purchase 15 Boom Overture aircraft, with an option to buy 35 more. They are scheduled to begin servicing passengers in 2029.
