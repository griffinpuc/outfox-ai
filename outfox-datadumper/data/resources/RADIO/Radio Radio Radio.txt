Radio Radio Radio is an EP by the American punk rock band Rancid. The EP was released on August 26, 1993, through Fat Wreck Chords with the catalog number FAT 509. It was also their only release on Fat Wreck Chords.
It is the first Rancid release with four members, with the inclusion of Lars Fredriksen on guitar and vocals. Previously a three-piece, Rancid was in need of a second guitar player to refine their sound. They had briefly performed live with Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day as their second guitar player, but Billie Joe decided to stay with Green Day rather than become a full member of Rancid. "Radio" was written in the short time that Billie Joe was in the band, and he therefore was a co-writer of the song. After Billie Joe decided to leave, Frederiksen filled the spot. Frederiksen had previously been a member of the British punk rock band the U.K. Subs.
"Radio" and "Dope Sick Girl" were both re-recorded for the band's second album, Let's Go, which was released the next year. The versions on the EP, "Radio" in particular, are arranged differently than the versions on Let's Go.
Fat Wreck Chords reissued the EP on January 15, 2009, on white vinyl.
