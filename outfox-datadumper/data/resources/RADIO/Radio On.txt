Radio On is a 1979 film directed by Christopher Petit. It is a rare example of a British road movie, shot in black and white by Wim Wenders' assistant cameraman Martin Sch√§fer and featuring music from a number of new wave bands of the time, as well as established artists such as Kraftwerk, Devo and David Bowie. It is a journey through late 1970s Britain by way of a road trip from London to Bristol, with Robert a DJ (played by David Beames) attempting to investigate the suicide of his brother. David Beames's character is a disc jockey at a radio station based on the United Biscuits Network, which broadcast to factories owned by United Biscuits.
